The Major Difference between CRUD operation with mongo and CRUD APis operation with mongo is that 
inside APIS doing CRUD is that in normal CRUD we are using functions to use mongo functionalities
and in case of APIS we are using APIS to Perform the the functionalities of mongo.

So dont confuse between normal CRUD and CRUD with APIS as it will gonna create mess for us so use 
them patiently and kindly.
