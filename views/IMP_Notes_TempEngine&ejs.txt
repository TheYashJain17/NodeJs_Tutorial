Information Regarding TEMPLATE ENGINE And EJS. 

We use Template engine for making dynamic websites, when we only render premaking pages like entry page of a website or anything which not gonna change is known as static page.
While there is a work where content have to be changed like opening someone's profile in that case we have to make dynamic website/page.
So For making dynamic content we have to use template engine and in this case we gonna use 'ejs' template engine that will help us to make dynamic content/website/page.

For using EJS/Template engine we always have to make a new folder and always have to give it the name views that is mandatory.
and after creating the folder when we make a file inside that folder we always have to use .ejs extension with it.
